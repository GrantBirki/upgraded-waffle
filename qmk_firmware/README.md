# QMK âŒ¨

Modified for the `upgraded-waffle` ðŸ§‡

## Usage

To use the `./run.sh` command, please ensure you have the following installed and ready to use:

- Docker
- Docker-compose
- Some flavor of bash (WSL or native Linux)

Tip: If you are on windows, you can follow this official guide to install all of the above -> [guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

### Steps

1. From this directory, run the following command: `./run.sh`
2. Follow the prompts - Example: `-kb: dumbpad` and `-km default`
3. Check for the output hex file in this directory. Example: `dumbpad_v1x_dualencoder_default.hex.output`
4. Rename/remove the `.output` from the filename to flash with QMK Toolbox
5. ðŸŽ‰

#### Explanation

The following steps above just built a Docker container. This docker container copied all the files from this directory and attached a volume to write the file back into our repo. It then built and compiled the keyboard/macro we provided during runtime. This is fed through `qmk compile` and then saved to our working directory as `<filename>.hex.output`. We then have to rename this file to remove the `.output` to use it within QMK Toolbox for flashing.

### Installing my custom keymap

> These are my own instructions for installing my custom keymap

My custom keymaps are located here: [birki](keyboards/dumbpad/v1x_dualencoder/keymaps/birki/keymap.c)

Edit the keymap to your liking and then run the command below:

```bash
$ ./run.sh
Enter Keyboard (Ex: dumbpad) -kb: dumbpad
Enter Keymap (Ex: default) -km: birki
```

Open QMK Toolbox and flash using the hex file compiled and stored in this directory:

> In my case, the compiled hex file is named `dumbpad-birki.hex`
